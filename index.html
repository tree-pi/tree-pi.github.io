        <h1 id=cogsci>As a cognitive science researcher: Understanding human with probabilistic modeling</h1>
        <p>Attracted by: Human curiosity, including the emotional drives (what emotion drives more interest?) and informational drives (how to quantify the informational state that motivates more learning?).</p>

        <p>Tricks: Designing experiments, programming, coming up mathematical models to explain human.</p>

        <h2>Thesis: Probabilistic models of subjective judgments</h2>
          
          <p>My thesis studied three topics related with the challenging topic of subjective judgments -- yes, it's quite a journey to extract some common mechanism among people's idiosynchratic judgments and feelings. The first two topics in my thesis respectively addressed the emotional drive and informational drive for self-motivated learning. </p>
          <ul>
         
            <li> The feeling of suspense in face of information to be revealed (Chapter 1). In collaboration with Todd Gureckis and Neil Bramley. Journal paper on <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699931.2021.1932429">Cognition and Emotion</a> or <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/532tw/download?format=pdf"> PsyArxiv</a>.  </li>

            <li> The satisfaction to an explanation given the statistical information of the causal structure (Chapter 2). In collaboration with Todd Gureckis and Bob Rehder.</li>
          
           <li> The last chapter studies how do people integrate their subjective values with sensory information, under a posterior-based (a term in Bayesian probability theory) utility framework. In collaboration with Wei Ji Ma. Journal paper on  <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009190">PLoS computational biology</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          

           <p>The common methodology of these three projects including behaviora paradigms and probabilistic modeling. Even if you are not an expert in probability theories, your brain may be one. I agree it seems crazy that some neuroscientists claim our brains could perform probabilitic calculations with Bayesian formalism...But throughout the years of my PhD research, I gradually came to realize that probabilistic modeling is a useful starting point, especially when investigating relatively new topics. </p>

          <h2>Scientific Knowledge Organized Through Question Network</h2>
            <p>This is my long-term passion project started when I was in my physics major in undergrad, when I found out that rather than trying to figure out the reasoning behind every formula on the textbook, the better way to learn is to focus on the <b>question</b> those formula are trying to solve, then explore the solution myself. All the questions can be organized into an organic network which is much easier to understand and follow. This method could be applied to almost any discipline of learning. Throughout years, I have tried different ways to progress this idea:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Research presentation at Poster in The 41st Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci). Poster <a href="files/quesnet_cogsci19.pdf">here</a>. Slides <a href = "https://github.com/tree-pi/Question_network_visualization/blob/main/quesnet_introduction.pdf">here</a>. </li>
            <li>Tools for systematically recording the question network and visualization. https://github.com/tree-pi/Question_network_visualization </li> 
            <li>Collection of example question networks with standardized question coding structure and visualization. https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~zli/ </li>

            <li>Off-line workshop series which introduce frontier scientific research to general public by question-oriented small-group discussion. Workshops happened mostly in Beijing with some in NYC. Information of the total 42 workshops in Beijing can be found at <a href="https://weixin.sogou.com/link?url=dn9a_-gY295K0Rci_xozVXfdMkSQTLW6EzDJysI4ql5MPrOUp16838dGRMI7NnPq95cBoEnQWV0IdthJnkmDewwvDqyjOWdz6eKAGeFI6p8SrPIN4kT88re77sTbpL6mmsCB21IRa1UKBYtdUsbL0IFyvqbRteFJqlpK952dpGDjQSEiPm6TlljHVJPGsNUC80yZgHOk4G2F7yCsa506YOO00efWrWmm&type=1&query=%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92&token=empty&k=7&h=T">问题网络计划</a> </li>
          </ul>

        <h1 id=human>As a human</h1>
        <p>Being a human is much more than cognition and knowlwedge. The two major areas of my personal growth in the recent years: about body/mind-body connection and about inter-human relationship. I'd like to share some helpful links here. </p>
          <h2>Somatic education and Feldenkrais</h2>
            <p>
            After taking Feldenkrais classes ("awareness through movement") for 2 years, I joined <a href="https://kelownafeldenkraistraining.ca/index.html">Kelowna Feldenkrais Teacher Training</a> in 2021 to become a Feldenkrais practitioner. I hope to learn more about my body with concrete practice, and will one day be able to help others feeling more ease, comfort and joy using their body.</p>

            <p>
            If you cannot find a local practitioner, there are many online video classes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FeldenkraiswithAlfons">Alfons</a> is one of my favorate Youtube teacher -- I would just find a mat, lay on the floor, and spend some relaxing time with my body.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you would like to read original materials from Moshe Feldenkrais and getting a better understanding of the worldview behind this method, here's two books I've read so far and like a lot: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583940685/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3">The Potent Self: A Study of Spontaneity and Compulsion</a> An overview of what is a potent self, what is maturity, how the society is forcing us to be certain way that's more limiting than enabling.
            </li>
            <li>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Awareness-Through-Movement-Easy-Do/dp/0062503227">Awareness through movement.</a> More focused on using the body. With ATM classes addressing different aspects (posture, standing, breathing, etc.).
            </li>
            </ul> 
            <p>
            Besides Feldenkrais, other body trainings I love including Parkour (if you are in NYC, search for NY Parkour), Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu and rock climbing. Or just walking and feel the body's flow.
            </p>

          <h2>Authentic relating</h2>
            <p>
            I completed level 1 and level 2 <a href="https://authenticrelating.co">Authentic Relating Training at ART International</a> (2020-2021). It is a transformative framework that helped me to be more authentic yet accepting when relating with others. It freed me from a nerd mostly living in my own head to be more perceptive about emotion and other people's deeper being beyond language. The very loving and supporting community also helped me to gain more confidence of being my real self yet still able to connect with others.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another resource in the same vein I found very helpful is <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc"> Non-Violent Communication</a>. It's simple yet highly insightful. Practicing it helped a lot with my relationship with family and partner.
